\chapter{Conclusion}

  In this paper we have presented a system that is able to capture an environment map in one place and recreate it in a room with controllable lamps.
  We have shown that our method is fast enough for real-time transfer and reproduces dynamic environment maps reliably.
  Our approach is general and works independently from the layout of the room and placement of the lighting system.
  We believe LEDs are the future of room lighting and expect to see a rise in the application of digital computer-controlled illuminants.
