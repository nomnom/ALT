Ambient Light Transfer - structure and content

               
------

1 Introduction
> short (0.5p) paragraph about the idea
 - Idea: capture 'light mood' at place A and reproduce it in an artificially lighted environment B in near-realtime
 - cameras + displays ommit a lot of information
 - possibilities of modern LED technology
 - ambient light and mood
 - enhanced teleconferences

 
2 Motivations
>(0.5-1p) why do we do this
 1 cameras+displays ommit a lot of information, esp. ambient light
 2 availability and future use of full-color RGB LEDs as room-lighting


3 Related Work
>(0.5-1p)
 1 FOV-Extention, Immersive Environments: 
	-Ambilight [R], Illumiroom [R], Bit-Dome [R], 
    -Lighting from virtual Envs. [R]
 2 Algo & Probe:
    - Relighting: Bayesian relighting [R]
    - Freeform Lightstage [R]
    - Image based relighting [R]

Ambient light and mood
> how are they related and how do they impact us
 - how does light impact mood, perception (esp. visual)
 - fov extension and user immersion
 - influence of color and brightness on mood
 - SAD and dynamic lighting in office rooms


LED based full color Room Lighting
> what is possible, benefits and how to do it
 1 state of LED technology
 2 scaling upwards
  - few Highpower LEDs vs. many lowpower
  - power and heat distribution
 3 future of LED lighting

Flow Outline 
> overview over the workflow; introduction of all parts of the system [I]
 1 location A: capture
   - capture probe 
   - optional: video source
   - streaming hardware
 2 transfer
   - streaming of both videos via network / internet
 3 location B: reproduce
   - led system and controller
   - receiving hardware: PC with our software
   - optional: video display
   - calibration probe

   
Our LED setup
> description of our setup (not extremely detailed, refer to appendix)
 1 room walls as low resolution display
 2 our Sticks and placement
 3 WS2812 LEDs, controller, serial interface
 4 interpolation in time-domain (fading)
 5 room considerations: big colored objects, specular highlights and gamut
 
Lightprobe
> how to capture light impact
 - mapping of sphere, parabolic or fisheye-lense
 - diffuse vs. specular (sphere considerations)
 - cheap webcams and their problems
 - our probe
 - probe calibration 

-----

Measuring Light Impact (room calibration)
> how to calibrate the room
 - choosing best light directions
 - nearest neighbor sampling on sphere
 - hdr probes
 - calibration routine
 - handling specular highlights


Realtime Transfer
 1 directly via streaming
  - bandwidth and framerate limits
  - compression artefacts
  - synchronous transmission of two video streams
  - optimization: sample at the source and transmit only light impact

 2 using Skype 
  - resolution limitations
  - dual-sphere lightprobe
  - possible calibration methods for uncontrollable cams
  -- single-image-only calibration [R]
  -- automatic parameters in webcams (Exp., Whitbalance, Gamma)

Reproducing Light Impact
> how to solve the inverse problem
 - energyterm over light directions
 - optimization algorithm
 - implementation details
 - complexity and speed optimizations


-----

Evaluation and Results
 - 
 - transfer of moving lightprobe (with scene cam)
 - realtime transfer via broadband or mobile network
 - enhanced telco: realtime transfer via skype
 - replay of timelapse recording (with szene cam) -> user survey?
 - reproducing appearance of an object (w/ pics)


Conclusion
 1 limitations
  - needs high input framerate
  - exposure and dark scenes
  - accuracy of webcams
  - gamut of LED system
  - low gamut optimization: weighting color lower than saturation
 
 2 enhancements
  - algo optimizations?
  - combine with audio for better ambience
 
 3 future
  > short overview where this could lead if: 
    - we would get ubiquitous room lighting: panels, wallpaper etc
    - and the sensor would be embedded in mobile phones / cams
